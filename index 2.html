            THE UNIVERSALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MULTICULTURALISM
            <br>
        </h1>

    <p>Elaborated in the middle of 1946 and today referred to as one of the most 
        important documents for guaranteeing a dignified life for human beings, 
        the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) can be considered as a very 
        recent document if we compare all the time of our existence before its elaboration. 
        Composed of 30 articles, this document aims to positively guarantee the basic rights 
        of every human being, from their right to life, security and freedom (art. 3) to their 
        right to have a nationality (art. 15 ), it is interesting to remember that these rights 
        were only guaranteed shortly after the end of the Second World War, where everyone had 
        their dignity forgotten and damaged amid the hatred and blood of the war that totaled 
        between 60 and 85 million deaths. After the UDHR came up, it would be too naive to think 
        that it would be properly followed by every individual, after all, we are talking about a 
        document that crosses borders and reaches the most diverse cultures, even today with a world 
        globalized where any and all information (correct or incorrect) it is disseminated in several 
        networks and digital media. The main point that belittles the vision of what Human Rights is 
        would be the fact that he defends precisely the Human being, being the purest of individuals 
        to the dirtiest of all and unfortunately we have a sick feeling of revenge that screams louder 
        than our common sense, after all, there is a grotesque irony in activating the right of an individual 
        who has deprived another of a crucial right such as the right to life. Although this document is 
        recognized across the globe, it is necessary to mention that due to the cultural differences of 
        several countries and their political issues, the articles are not even taken into account, as an 
        example we have China, which have been highlighted in the media due to themes such as the surveillance 
        systems used to invade the people's privacy, concentration camps for Muslims and the persecution and 
        death of members of Falun Gong / Dafa for organ harvesting that started after their ban in 1999, 
        totaling more than 100 million deaths. This example was of just one country that deprives its people 
        of basic rights such as having a private life or exercising their religion, but considering all of 
        them, it is impossible to quantify the number of people who have had their dignity damaged. Finally, 
        as long as countries do not talk about this lack of consideration for the rights of their inhabitants, 
        degrading situations will be recurrent in our lives and in the end, the Law will not be guaranteed to 
        Humans, but to a portion of us, becoming not “Rights”, but “Privileges”.
